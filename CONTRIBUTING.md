# Contributing

From opening bug reports to creating pull requests, every contribution is appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change the way an existing feature works please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your work is not wasted.

## Process

1. Requirements are mentioned in the main [README](./README.md) and READMEs of the individual components. 

1. Fork, then clone the repository.

1. Create a new branch based on 'main' and start to make your changes.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

1. Once you're happy, push your branch and open a pull request ([help](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)).

   ```sh
   git push origin -u my-feature
   ```

## Additional notes
